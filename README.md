# Overview
Created this after going through the pain of building custom excel to calculate the total apartment ownership cost &amp; loan amounts.

This is a web page where you can input the pricing aspects of a new apartment, calaculate the standard loan amount and then also guide you to see if buying or renting makes sense.

# Usage
After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
